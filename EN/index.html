				<p>Here is the personal website of <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:瑞丽江的河水">瑞丽江的河水</a> (my username in internet, which means water in the Shweli River). I come from Mangshi, Yunnan, China and resides in Ireland now. I am a Yunnan history and geography enthusiast, and also interested in gazetteers. I edited Wikipedia in my off school free time, and I was an administrator of Chinese Wikipedia from 2019 to 2021. I am currently studying the computer science honour Bachelor module at the Technological University of Dublin (TU Dublin). This website was built based on my Web Development 2 (PHP) course assignment, which was in the 1st term of the 2ed year. Please forgive I am not good at user interface design.</p>
				<p>What can this website do?</p>
				<ol style="line-height:180%; list-style-position:inside;">
					<li>The "Library" has my e-books catalog, and I can cite them easily when editing Wikipedia.</li>
					<li>Anybody can ask for literature mutual aid on Yunnan topics, not limited to the e-books I already have.</li>
					<li>Practice web programming new skills I learnt.</li>
